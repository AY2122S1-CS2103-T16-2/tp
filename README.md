* This is **a team project by Software Engineering (SE) students currently taking CS2103**.<br>
* It is named `ProfAddressBook Level 3` (`**P**AB3` for short) because it was based on the `AddressBook Level 3` 
  application.
* This is an application made for CS2103 Instructors to manage both students and TAs contacts within teams and tutorial 
  groups. It is optimized for CLI users so that tasks can be done in bulk especially when dealing with huge number 
  of contacts.
* For a detailed User Guide please visit our [product website](https://ay2122s1-cs2103-t16-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html)
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org/)
